#Arsatech-Vital-Tracker
ðŸš€ ESP32-based real-time health monitoring system


Arsatech-Vital-Tracker is a real-time health monitoring system based on ESP32 Wroom DA, developed during an internship at Arsatechnology. This system collects and visualizes biometric sensor data, displaying it in a medical-style graphical interface for real-time monitoring.

Features
âœ… Body & Ambient Temperature Monitoring â€“ Uses MLX90614 to measure object and ambient temperature (0-100Â°C).
âœ… Heart Rate & SpO2 Tracking â€“ Uses MAX30102 to detect heart rate (40-180 BPM) and oxygen saturation (80-100%).
âœ… Object Detection â€“ Uses TCRT5000 to detect object presence with a binary output (0 = no object, 1 = object detected).
âœ… Real-Time Visualization â€“ Displays sensor data in a live medical-style graph using Python & Matplotlib.

Hardware Requirements
ESP32 Wroom DA
MLX90614 (Infrared Temperature Sensor)
MAX30102 (Pulse Oximeter & Heart Rate Sensor)
TCRT5000 (Optical Sensor for Object Detection)
Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE (for ESP32 programming)
Python 3.x with required libraries:
pyserial â€“ for serial communication
matplotlib â€“ for data visualization
threading â€“ for handling serial data asynchronously
