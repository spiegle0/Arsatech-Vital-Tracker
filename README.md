#Arsatech-Vital-Tracker

ðŸš€ ESP32-based real-time health monitoring system

#Overview
Arsatech-Vital-Tracker is a real-time health monitoring system based on ESP32 Wroom DA, developed during an internship at #Arsatechnology. This system collects and visualizes biometric sensor data, displaying it in a medical-style graphical #interface for real-time monitoring.

#Code Versions
This project includes two versions of code:

1.ESP32 (Arduino IDE) â€“ The firmware that runs on the ESP32 to read data from sensors and send it via Serial communication.
2.Python (PC Visualization) â€“ A Python script that reads the serial data from ESP32 and visualizes it using Matplotlib in a medical-style graph.
#Features :
âœ… Body & Ambient Temperature Monitoring â€“ Uses MLX90614 to measure object and ambient temperature (0-100Â°C).
âœ… Heart Rate & SpO2 Tracking â€“ Uses MAX30102 to detect heart rate (40-180 BPM) and oxygen saturation (80-100%).
âœ… Object Detection â€“ Uses TCRT5000 to detect object presence with a binary output (0 = no object, 1 = object detected).
âœ… Real-Time Visualization â€“ Displays sensor data in a live medical-style graph using Python & Matplotlib.
